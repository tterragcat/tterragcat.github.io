        <p> <em>“You see our enemy over there men?</em><br> <strong>I <em>pity</em> them.</strong><br>
        <br>

Our foes outnumber us three to one. They have spent more time training than you’ve been alive. They’re fast and they’re mean, and by the end of today every single one of them will be dead.<br>

You see men, our opponents are probably the strongest and most agile creatures in the known galaxy, but they are no soldiers. They live in harmony with their planet’s ecosystem. There is no pollution, no wars, no disaster and no famine. The bond between them and their planet has formed them into mighty creatures. They believe mankind is impure and our philosophies are monstrous. They believe that, with the power of their natural prowess and their spirituality, they can wipe humanity from existence.<br>

<strong>They are dead wrong.</strong><br>

While they have been sitting around eating food that virtually fell into their laps, we have been stabbing our neighbors in the back for <em>a scrap of bread.</em><br>

While they have been singing tales of the harmony and magic of nature, we have watched our children whither away to husks from a bloody plague.<br>

While they have sat sunning their wretched furry hides in sunny calm meadows, we have clung desperately to survival in frozen tundras and barren deserts.<br>

Our suffering has become our strength. Despite the best attempts of nature, God and even our fellow man, humanity stands strong. Humanity can survive anything, a fact that those sorry fools don’t understand.<br>

Let us enlighten our foes to the unyielding spirit of mankind. <br>
<br>
Our very existance is a testemate to the inextiguishable spark that is man, you can put him down, subjegate him, fight against him forever. <strong>Man will never roll over and die. So get up! Fight them until they understand. There is no way against man to win!<em> We shape nature! We mold our world to our ways!</em></strong>

        It is the end, The battlefield is littered with debris and dead bodies. Those who are still alive, even those who are just barely, staying silent in awe. At the carnage, at the depravity they had just taken part of. <br>

The aliens stand by, They watch as slowly, The Humans begin to rise. They pick themselves and each other up. They lift members of other species with them and they can not help but be in awe of these small creatures. <br>

They are not fast, They have no natural amour or weapons. Yet they are fierce, nearly limitless in their desire to protect those they consider allies. When broken they piece themselves back together, They gather their dead and ‘Honor” them. <br>

Humans where the first to pick up arms against the Extulians, The first to publicly outcry and later rampage for the rights of other races. The humans rose up and defended the weak where the Embassy could not. The Humans took to the battlefields and showed the universe what Planet Earth had produced.<br>

The humans may have thought their savagery would scare the Embassy, Would make the others fear or even hate them.<br>

But for their dark and bloody history, The Embassy did not see soldiers, not killers or savages. They saw a race so full of compassion that it drove them to violence. A race so full of protective instinct that they laid down their lives for aliens they had never met. <br>
<br>
The Embassy saw Guardians and Protectors.

“Human? What’s a Human?”<br>

“Not what, who. He’s the most feared bounty hunter in the system.”<br>

“What makes him so special? Cybernetics? Psyonics? Whatever it is, we’ve beaten it before.”<br>

“That’s just it, there is no trick. Nothing. Plain Vanilla biology and no weapons beyond chemically propelled kinetics and edged tools.”<br>

“You’re kidding, right? Then why is he such a big deal?”<br>

“He’s a big deal because he does the job without anything like that. He can track you down and kill you without any net-dives or mind scans, and there’s nothing we’ve got that can shut him down. He’s not cybernetic so we can’t EM him, and he’s got no psychic presence so we can’t psybomb him. There’s almost no way to track him down or get away once he’s found you.”<br>

“Can’t we just kill him?”<br>

“Good luck. First you’ve got to find him, and they say he can disguise himself as anything.”<br>

“Like what, posing as that vending machine?”<br>

“No, I’m posing as the drinking fountain.”<br>

        The Mars Rovers embody what I feel are the best traits of Humanity. Our Spirit, that fire deep inside all of us, pushing us all to our extremes. Our Curiosity, moving us to question everything around us until we know everything about our surroundings, and then moving us to find a new place and beginning the process of learning again. Our Opportunity, or rather our taking of them, that led mankind into space and onto the moon with a computer less powerful than the device you’re reading this on.<br>
<br>
Finally, there’s Sojourner. Unlike the others it isn’t as much of a feeling as it is a lifestyle. To be a Sojourner means “to stay or reside in a place temporarily.” This need for us to move fuels our emotions, our Spirit, our Curiosity, our Opportunity.<br>
<br>
I believe that the rovers know. They know that they embody our hopes, our dreams, our passions. They know they are our future, a bright one of expansion and progress. They know this and they are proud<br>

        We abducted humans.<br>
<br>
To be fair, we abducted members of every new race. Abduct a small percentage of the population, expose them to some galactic prisoners, and we get a good idea of what germs, diseases, and viruses will make the jump between races. Do this over the course of a [roughly equivalent to a century], and you get a good idea of what there is, how quickly it mutates, etc. You also have the time to develop vaccines for any races that might be affected by the new race (including itself- we’re not heartless).<br>
<br>
But we underestimated humans.<br>
<br>
It was [roughly equivalent to four decades] into our testing of humanity. We picked up a human from his transport and placed him in a containment cell. He had some nutrients with him, and we picked that up too: less we had to feed him later.<br>
<br>
But we underestimated the resourcefulness of humans.<br>
<br>
Something went wrong- we think it was a door malfunction- and he escaped the cell. He disabled the guards easily (we suspect they were less alert than they should have been) and took their weapons. We locked all hatches, hoping to seal him in the laboratory wing. Unfortunately, he hacked the shipboard computer, gaining control of all systems. He made his way to the bridge, where he took the captain hostage. We offered him riches, technologies beyond human understanding.<br>
<br>
But we underestimated the stubbornness of humans.<br>
<br>
He was paid us no mind as he wrestled with the controls, as if on some quest. He punched numbers and figures into the console, and mumbled something about ‘being lit on fire’ by a superior. He set the ship down on the other side of the city from where he was picked up and opened the doors. We braced ourselves for a military confrontation, but it seemed like we were outside another human’s abode. He jumped out, carrying the nutrients with him.<br>
<br>
We underestimated Domino’s 30-minute or free guarantee.
